## The <u>fastest way ever</u> to make an open source project profitable.

Nostrocket is a **[Self Organizing Unorganization (SOU)](/self-organizing-unorganization.html) factory** built with Bitcoin and Nostr. It provides a hyper-efficient and radically fair way for anyone to collaborate on open source projects for *fun and profit*.

Nostrocket makes open source projects **hyper-efficient** because work can be done asynchronously without [organizational mutexes](/mutexes.html). It makes them [radically fair](/protocol.html) in the way that participants form consensus over the value of each contribution. 

It makes projects **rapidly profitable** by providing guard rails against solving problems that are not in the **critical path** to more participation and revenue. It makes them **perpetually sustainable** in the way that they [distribute project revenue](/protocol.html) to project creators, investors, and contributors.

### A huge thanks to OpenSats!
`>_OpenSats` has [provided a grant to Nostrocket](https://opensats.org/blog/nostr-grants-october-2023). This has made a huge difference and enabled things to move much faster.
